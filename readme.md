# Leafy: a phaser.io game experiment

Rough sketch for my first game.

### Controls
1. Left/Right arrow keys to move
2. Spacebar to jump
3. Nothing else, pretty boring so far.

## Install
```
git clone git@github.com:daverau/leafy.git
cd leafy
npm install
node server.js
```

## Todo
- add start/end game states
- wire up sound effects
- kill player on world bound exit

- explore timers for speed boost
- flexbox vertical centering (it's still kinda cryptic)
- finish drawing dynamic trees (cool experiment with vue here for tree types with sliders on properties)
- add doorway sprite with collide event
- dynamic width so canvas fills wide desktop screens (calc+js?)

# Done recently...
- retina issues mostly resolved
- add tree pngs
- expand world size

## Someday
- explore vue.js for less update code
- leaf powerups
- finish owl drawing
- draw inside of tree
- draw lady bug
- explore tree timers for growing and changing leaves
- player inventory
- enable tree planting
- nighttime
