# Leafy: a phaser.io game experiment

Rough sketch for my first game.

## Install & Run:
```
git clone git@github.com:daverau/leafy.git
cd leafy
npm install
node server.js
```

## Todo
- add tree svgs
- wire up sound effects
- add start/end game states
- explore timers for speed boost
- kill player on world bound exit
- explore vue.js for less update code
- flexbox vertical centering (it's still kinda cryptic)
- bigger world
- finish drawing dynamic trees (cool experiment with vue here for tree types with sliders on properties)
- doorways w/collision
- leaf powerups
- player inventory
- finish owl drawing
