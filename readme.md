# Leafy: a phaser.io game experiment

Leafy is a game about growing and exploring. You start in the middle of a field where you can go left or right.

### Controls
1. Left/Right arrow keys to move
2. Spacebar to jump
3. Collect the blue leaves
4. Avoid the bees until you have flowers

## Sketch

## Done
- retina issues mostly resolved
- add tree pngs
- expand world size
- kill player on world bound exit
- add UI text for distance
- weighted randomization for more interesting tree distribution (needs more refinement, perhaps with less overlap)
- add leaf pick-ups with sound and simple counter
- owl flys away on first collide
- quick trees in front with a second loop and tree.group
- owl comes back after time
- draw add bee enemy
- crude plant trees working (removed)
- add flower pickups
- add gaps to require jumping
- add player inventory
- moon and rain
- jump on trees you plant (removed)
- blue leaf jump boost (removed)
- add game structure for start/end states
- add touch controls
- wrap in phonegap
- submit to iOS app store (testflight beta)
- refine gaps (only a dozen vs 500 before)

## Todo
- bees drop honey
- draw bear
- doorway sprite with collide event
- bear near doorway
- draw inside of tree
- design start/end screens
- music
- background image for effect
- move flowers, blueleaves and trees from gaps
- rework wrapping/camera follow
